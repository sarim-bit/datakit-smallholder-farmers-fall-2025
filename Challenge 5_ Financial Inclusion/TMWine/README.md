## financial inclusion keyword filter and text classifier

Included are 3 scripts and 2 short dictionaries for,
* filtering the raw raw_dataset_producers_direct.csv file by keywords relevant to financial inclusion, which out of about 2.8M unique English language questions produced about 237K unique rows
* performing text classification on the questions in the 237K rows, producing 7 classes of questions, explained in the FI_Claude_label_subset.py code comments

This only filters for financial inclusion keyword entries, and categorizes them--it does not include any anaylysis.
